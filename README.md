## Collaborating on GitHub
Fork the repository from https://github.com/modscripps/niskine to your GitHub account and clone the repository to your local computer from there.

Add the primary repository:
`git remote add upstream https://github.com/modscripps/niskine.git`

To make changes, create a new branch via
`git checkout -b <branch-name>` and hack away.
Add and commit your changes using `git add` and `git commit`.
Push the branch to your personal GitHub account with `git push -u origin <branch-name>`.
When done developing, head to your fork on GitHub and click `Compare & pull request` to merge the changes onto the main branch on the primary repository.
Pull the changes on the main branch to your local computer via `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main`.
